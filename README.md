# Fun with First Class Functions


## Summary/Motivation

This repository is a part of my "fun with" series. Each and every day I challenge myself to learn something new. Once I feel like I understand a subject well enough to move onto the next one, I build a small proof of concept or example so that I can reference it in the future. It also has the double benefit of serving as a great learning resource for my Bootcamp students.

One of the biggest stumbling blocks I've seen my students face is dealing with first class functions in JavaScript. Decided to make a little helper repo to show some examples!

## Structure

Each directory is a different example.

Examples: 

1. Basic function declaration
2. Passing function as a parameter

## Starting the project

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the desired file with `node <file_name>`


## Todo

- [] Function Expression
- [] Higher order functions
